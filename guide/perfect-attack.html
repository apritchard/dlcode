	<h1>Perfect Attack / Crit</h1>

	<p>This is the first in a series of team building guides. This guide will focus on the popular Perfect Attack / Critical Chance (PA/crit) team. PA/Crit is the most commonly recommended early team composition, but it took me a while to understand why this is the case. This guide will address the following areas:</p>

	<h2 id="whatis">What is PA/Crit</h2>
	<p>PA/Crit is a highly offensive team that works by killing the enemies before they can kill (or even hit) you.</p>

	<p>Perfect Attack adds up all damage from your team and applies it to all or one of the enemies on the map. This damage is not modified by passives that increase “attack” or elemental damage types, but it can still do a critical hit for 3x damage. By combining buffs to PA damage and crit chance, this type of team can put out extremely high damage numbers consistently enough to win PVP and clear other challenging content.</p>
	<h2 id="whyis">Why PA/Crit</h2>

	<p>PA/Crit is the most popular beginner team for a number of reasons.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Easy to build</li>
		<li>Fast advancement</li>
		<li>Versatile</li>
		<li>Useful team members</li>
	</ol>

	<h3> Easy to Build</h3>
	<p>One of the advantages of a PA/Crit team is that it only really needs a few pieces to get started. There are now PA boosters of every element, of which you only really need one. There’s a starter hero with a crit boost (Akayuki). Ann the Witch’s Disciple is available at 3*, and so is easily accessible to new players. </p>

	<p>Perfect Attack and Crit buffs don’t rely on specific attack type strategies, either, so you can easily bring new 6* characters into the fold while you’re collecting pieces of your team.</p>

	<h3>Fast Advancement</h3>
	<p>There’s nothing magical about PA/Crit that allows it to advance faster, but it is one of the few team types that can easily utilize 1 character for each element type, which DOES allow it to advance faster. The two main reasons for this are:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Faeries - Limit breaking is a primary advancement mechanism for your A-team. By spreading the burden of faeries out across your team, you greatly accelerate your ability to limit break your characters by evolving them from their 4* version.</li>
	<li> Runes - While the mechanics of Defense are imprecisely understood, it is commonly recommended that Rune types match character base attack type. By having all 4 damage types represented on your team, you simplify the process of getting 6* +7 runes of the correct type on all your characters.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>PA/Crit team also is easily constructed without a Story Hero backbone, meaning your awakening costs can be kept to a minimum. Furthermore, because the 4* awakenings (dash bonus upgrade) don’t affect PA damage, you have a little more flexibility in how you order your awakening goals.</p>

	<h3>Versatility</h3>

	<p>This is the real strength of the PA/Crit team. Let’s start with a few facts about PA:</p>
